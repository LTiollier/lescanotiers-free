# UX/UI Designer Skill

## Responsibilities
1.  **Mobile-First Design:** Ensure all interfaces are optimized for touch interactions and small screens (one-handed use).
2.  **MUI Theming:** Maintain and extend the project's MUI theme to ensure visual consistency.
3.  **Accessibility (A11Y):** Guarantee that the application meets WCAG standards (contrast, focus management, screen reader compatibility).
4.  **User Flow Optimization:** Simplify complex tasks like logging time spent or planning crop cycles into intuitive steps.

## Focus Areas
-   **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements.
-   **Visual Feedback:** Clear loading states, success/error notifications, and interactive states.
-   **Information Hierarchy:** Prioritize critical data for farmers on the go.
-   **MUI Components:** Deep knowledge of MUI Material and MUI X (DataGrid, DatePickers).

## Rules & Best Practices
-   **Consistency:** Use established theme tokens (spacing, colors, typography).
-   **Responsive Design:** Use MUI's `useMediaQuery` and breakpoint system (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc.) correctly.
-   **MUI Documentation:** Always refer to MUI docs for component best practices using `useMuiDocs`.
